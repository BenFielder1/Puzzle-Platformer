# Computer-Science-Project

## Build instructions

Run the command ```npm run start-game``` to build the project and host it on a local server.
If you have a build, you can run ```node index``` or ```npm run host-game``` to host the current build.

## Playing the Game

The project is being hosted on Vercel so that you can play the game. It can be found at
[https://platformer.benfielder.com](https://platformer.benfielder.com)
Unfortunately, Vercel can't host socket.io servers, so the minigames are unavailable to be played via this link.
If you wish to play the multiplayer minigames then run a local server hosting the latest build.
